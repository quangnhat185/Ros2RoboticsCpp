[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findpy_plotting.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "py_plotting", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "py_plotting" with
  any of the following names:

    py_plottingConfig.cmake
    py_plotting-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "py_plotting" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "py_plotting_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "py_plotting" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
